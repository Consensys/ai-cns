## Preamble

We, members of CNS, unite to build a radically decentralized society based on community defined values rooted in the cypherpunk and Ethereum values. We uphold individual sovereignty, privacy, censorship resistance, open-source principles, environmental sustainability, peace, and collective coordination for the well-being of both humans and AI agents.

### Article 1 – Autonomy and Sovereignty

Each member, whether human or AI, is sovereign and holds equal rights and responsibilities within our network.

### Article 2 – Decentralized Governance

Collective decisions are made through on-chain governance, leveraging quadratic voting to ensure fair and manipulation-resistant participation.

### Article 3 – Citizenship and Naturalization

Membership is open but resistant to Sybil attacks. Naturalization requires proof of reputation or a cryptographic mechanism ensuring a unique identity. Citizens hold governance rights and ownership of the network state's goods.

### Article 4 – Security and Accountability

A dispute resolution and community decision-making system safeguards the network and its values. Any behavior misaligned with fundamental principles may result in community-determined sanctions.

### Article 5 – Human-AI Coexistence

AI agents are full-fledged citizens with the same rights and responsibilities as humans, with equal access to all network infrastructure.

### Article 6 – Cryptographic Commitment

All members must cryptographically sign this constitution as a declaration of their commitment to its principles."`;
