# Tree Ring Model of Culture and Politics

## Core Concept

The Tree Ring Model explains how societies regulate technologies and activities based on when they emerged:

1. **Formation Period**: How a culture treats new things is determined by the attitudes and incentives prevalent at the time of their emergence
2. **Solidification**: Once established, these attitudes become resistant to change due to status quo bias
3. **Layering**: Each era adds a new "ring" with distinct regulatory approaches, while previous rings remain largely unchanged

## Key Principles

### Status Quo Bias in Regulation

- New regulations are easier to create than to remove
- Existing frameworks become entrenched and difficult to modify
- Different technologies face different regulatory environments based on their "birth era"

### Era-Specific Treatment

- Technologies and activities are regulated according to the cultural attitudes prevalent when they first gained prominence
- This creates apparent contradictions where similar activities face different regulatory approaches

## Historical Examples

### Internet Regulation

- The internet "came of age" in the 1990s during a deregulatory period
- Resulted in decades of relative freedom compared to later digital technologies
- Early internet freedoms have persisted despite general shifts toward more regulation

### Social Media vs. Early Internet

- Social media emerged in the 2010s under different cultural attitudes
- Faces stricter scrutiny and regulation than earlier internet technologies
- Despite growing internet authoritarianism, older internet activities (like file sharing) haven't seen equivalent crackdowns

### AI Development Patterns

- AI matured in the 2020s with unexpected regulatory patterns
- China unexpectedly embraced open-source AI while the US pursued more closed models
- This counterintuitive outcome reflects current geopolitical positions rather than traditional cultural values

### Risk Tolerance

- Modern technological risks face stricter regulation than traditional risky activities
- Mountain climbing (with high mortality rates) faces less restriction than newer risky technologies
- Reflects the era when risk assessment frameworks for these activities solidified

## Implications

### Innovation Strategy

- Changing established regulatory patterns is extremely difficult
- More effective to create new technologies and communities with better initial norms
- The timing of a technology's emergence critically affects its long-term regulatory environment

### Cryptocurrency Significance

- Crypto represents an independent technological and cultural ground
- Offers opportunity to establish new norms without the burden of existing status quo bias
- Functions as "new trees" rather than attempting to reshape existing regulatory forests

### Cultural Evolution

- Societies don't apply consistent principles across all domains
- Instead, they layer new regulatory approaches on top of existing ones
- Understanding this pattern helps explain apparent contradictions in regulatory philosophy
