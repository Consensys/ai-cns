# Open Source vs Public Goods Funding

## Core Argument

The concept of "public goods" has become diluted and confusing in digital ecosystems, while "open source" provides a clearer, more rigorous framework for funding valuable shared resources. This shift in terminology can improve funding allocation and reduce social gaming of the system.

## Problems with "Public Goods" Framing

### Definitional Confusion

- **Common Misunderstanding**: "Public good" often interpreted as "government-produced good" rather than its economic definition
- **Dilution of Meaning**: Term increasingly used by commercial projects with tokens to describe themselves
- **Subjective Application**: Definition stretched to the point where it often simply means "project"

### Social Gaming Vulnerability

- **Perception Problem**: Public goods funding seen as lacking rigor and driven by social desirability bias
- **Insider Advantage**: System favors those who can effectively play social games
- **Accountability Issues**: Difficult to evaluate whether projects truly create diffuse value

## Benefits of "Open Source" Framing

### Clear Definition

- **Established Standards**: Free Software Definition (FSF) and Open Source Definition (OSI) provide decades-old frameworks
- **Extensible**: Can be naturally extended to fields beyond software (writing, research)
- **Blockchain Extensions**: Can incorporate concepts like open standards, insider attack test, and walkaway test

### Alignment with Digital Public Goods

- **Natural Overlap**: Most digital public goods are already open source:
  - Academic blockchain and cryptographic research
  - Documentation and tutorials
  - Software libraries and clients
- **Default Public Good**: Open-sourcing inherently creates diffuse benefits

## Addressing Physical Public Goods

### Global vs Local Scale

- **Global Solutions**: Most efficient global solutions to physical public goods involve open source components
- **Clean Air Example**: Research and development to improve air quality worldwide is largely open source
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Open source can help make physical infrastructure easier to deploy globally

### National Defense Consideration

- **Moral Complexity**: Projects that benefit one nation at the expense of others may not be global public goods
- **Open-Source Test**: If a project cannot be comfortably open-sourced, it may not be a true global public good
- **Defensive Focus**: Truly beneficial national defense projects (like decentralized infrastructure) can and should be open-sourced

## Implementation Benefits

- **Reduced Gaming**: Harder to misrepresent commercial projects as "open source" than as "public goods"
- **Clearer Evaluation**: Easier to assess whether something meets open source criteria
- **Value Alignment**: Still allows for prioritizing projects with maximum value to humanity
- **Maintained Focus**: The core task of determining which projects deserve support remains unchanged
