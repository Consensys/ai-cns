# Cypherpunk Manifesto

## Core Principles

### Privacy Definition

- **Privacy vs. Secrecy**: Privacy is not secrecy—private matters are selectively shared, secret matters are shared with no one
- **Selective Disclosure**: Privacy is the power to choose what personal information to reveal and to whom
- **Fundamental Right**: Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age

### Technical Requirements

- **Anonymous Transactions**: Systems that enable interaction without revealing identity
- **Strong Cryptography**: Essential for protecting communications and ensuring privacy
- **Digital Signatures**: Required for verifiable identity when anonymity is the default state
- **Open Source Code**: Freely published software that anyone can use and improve

## Key Arguments

### Information Dynamics

- **Speech Freedom**: Freedom of speech is even more fundamental than privacy in an open society
- **Information Spread**: Electronic communications enable unprecedented information sharing
- **Institutional Incentives**: Governments and corporations benefit from collecting and sharing personal data
- **Information Nature**: Information naturally expands and seeks to be free

### Transaction Privacy

- **Minimal Disclosure**: Each party should only know what is directly necessary for a transaction
- **Identity Irrelevance**: Personal identity is often not relevant to transactions (e.g., cash purchases)
- **System Design**: When transaction mechanisms force identity revelation, privacy is impossible

## Cypherpunk Action Plan

### Building Solutions

- **Code Writing**: "Cypherpunks write code"—creating practical tools for privacy protection
- **Anonymous Systems**: Developing technologies for anonymous transactions and communications
- **Tool Distribution**: Publishing free code worldwide for all to use
- **Resistance**: Opposing regulations on cryptography as fundamentally anti-privacy

### Implementation Strategy

- **Social Contract**: Privacy requires collective action and deployment of privacy systems
- **Community Cooperation**: Privacy extends only as far as cooperation among participants
- **Global Spread**: Cryptography will spread worldwide despite national restrictions
- **Engagement**: Seeking questions and concerns while maintaining commitment to goals

## Practical Applications

- **Anonymous Mail**: Forwarding systems that protect communication metadata
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic proof of identity when desired
- **Electronic Money**: Private transaction systems for financial exchanges
- **Encrypted Communications**: Ensuring messages are only readable by intended recipients
