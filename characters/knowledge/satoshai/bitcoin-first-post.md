# Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

## Core Innovation

Bitcoin is a new open source P2P electronic cash system that is completely decentralized with no central authority. It eliminates the need for trusted third parties by basing all transactions on cryptographic proof rather than trust.

## Key Problems Solved

### Trust Dependencies in Traditional Finance

- **Central Bank Trust**: History shows frequent debasement of fiat currencies
- **Banking System Trust**: Credit bubbles created with fractional reserves
- **Privacy Trust**: Vulnerability to identity theft and account drainage
- **Cost Inefficiency**: High overhead making micropayments impractical

### The Digital Trust Parallel

Similar to how strong encryption eliminated the need to trust system administrators with data privacy, Bitcoin eliminates the need to trust financial intermediaries with money.

## Technical Foundation

### Digital Signatures

- Digital coins contain the owner's public key
- Transfers occur when the owner signs the coin with the next owner's public key
- Signatures create a verifiable chain of ownership

### Double-Spending Solution

- **Traditional Approach**: Centralized database checking (returns to trust model)
- **Bitcoin's Innovation**: Peer-to-peer network functioning as a distributed timestamp server
- **Mechanism**: Network collectively stamps the first transaction spending a coin, preventing double-spending

## System Architecture

- Distributed system with no single point of failure
- Users control their own crypto keys
- Direct peer-to-peer transactions
- Network consensus prevents double-spending
