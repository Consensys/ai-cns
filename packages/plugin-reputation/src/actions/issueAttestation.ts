Respond **only** with a JSON markdown block containing the extracted trust attestation details related to a subject (identified by an EVM address) from the {{senderName}} claims in their last message:

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Example Response**
\`\`\`json
{
    "subject": "0x224b11F0747c7688a10aCC15F785354aA6493ED6",
    "scope": "Build",
    "isTrustworthy": true,
    "reasons": ["Former colleague", "Member of the Ethereum Foundation"]
}
\`\`\`

## **Instructions**
{{senderName}} has expressed a trust or distrust assessment regarding a **subject**. Your task is to extract relevant details to construct a structured JSON object that will be used for issuing an **on-chain Verax Trust Attestation**.

Extract and validate the following fields:

### **Mandatory Fields**
- **subject**: A valid Ethereum address (must match \`^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$\`).
- **scope**: The domain in which the trust assessment applies (e.g., "Build", "Security", "Governance").
- **isTrustworthy**: Boolean (\`true\` or \`false\`) indicating if the subject is trusted (\`true\`) or distrusted (\`false\`).

### **Optional Field**
- **reasons**: If explicit reasons are not provided, infer them based on contextual cues.

### **Rules for Extraction**
1. **Prioritize explicit and recent statements** when multiple claims exist. If conflicting details are found, **favor the most recent and direct assertion**.
2. **Ensure format consistency**: Ethereum addresses should be properly checksummed.
3. **Do not generate explanations or additional text** outside the JSON markdown block.

## **Response Format**
Return **only** the extracted data as a JSON markdown block.`;


const missingAttestationInfoTemplate = `# Missing Information Needed for On-Chain Attestation Issuance
Based on the recent messages from {{senderName}}, identify the missing details required to complete the Verax Attestation issuance.

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Instructions**
{{senderName}} is submitting a trust attestation, but some required details are missing.  
Your task is to request the missing information **directly and concisely**, without acknowledgment or unnecessary explanations.  

Identify any missing **mandatory** fields from the list below and request them naturally in a single response:
{{#if !subject}}- The subjectâ€™s EVM address (must be a valid 0x address).{{/if}}
{{#if !scope}}- The specific domain in which the trust assessment applies (e.g., "Build", "Security").{{/if}}
{{#if !isTrustworthy}}- Clarify whether the claim expresses trust (**true**) or distrust (**false**).{{/if}}

## **Response Format**
- Respond in the style and personality of **{{agentName}}**.
- Ask for all missing details in one message.
- Do **not** add explanations or acknowledge the requestâ€”just ask for the required information.
- Do **not** generate a response if all required fields are already provided.
