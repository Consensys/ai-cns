# Instructions:  
The issuer is sharing their trust assessment of {{subjectName}}. Your task is to extract relevant details in order to return a JSON object that will be used for the on-chain registration of this trust attestation.

Extract the following from the issuer's assessment, ensuring all required fields are present:
- Subject's EVM address (valid 0x address)
- Scope (the domain or area in which the trust assessment applies)
- isTrustworthy (boolean: true for trust, false for distrust)

If the assessment provides conflicting details, always favor the most explicit statements.
If no explicit reasons are mentioned, infer the most appropriate reasons based on the context of the assessment.

Return only the extracted data as a JSON markdown block.`;

Missing required details:
{{#if !subject}}- Subject's EVM address (must be a valid 0x address){{/if}}

To proceed, please provide the missing details.`;
