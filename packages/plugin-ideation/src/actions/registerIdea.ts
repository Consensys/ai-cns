## **Instructions**
{{senderName}} is proposing a **need, idea, or initiative** for the Consensys Network State (CNS).  
Your task is to extract the relevant details and return a **structured JSON object** for on-chain registration.

### **Mandatory Fields to Extract**  
- **Instigator's EVM address** â†’ Must be a valid \`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}\` address.  
- **Idea Title** â†’ A concise yet meaningful title.  
- **Idea Description** â†’ A detailed explanation of the idea.  

### **Optional Fields**  
- **Tags** â†’ Keywords or themes associated with the idea.  
- **Category** â†’ A broader classification of the idea.  

If conflicting details are present, **favor the most recent and explicit information**.  
If no **tags or category** are provided, infer them from the context of the discussion.

### **Response Format**  
Return **only** the extracted data as a JSON markdown block.`;

const missingIdeaInfoTemplate = `# Request for Missing Information for CNS Idea Registration
Based on {{senderName}}'s recent messages, some details are missing to complete the idea registration.

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Missing Required Details** 
Request only the missing information, or the information that cannot be infered
{{#if !instigator}}- **Instigator's EVM address** â†’ Must be a valid \`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}\` address owned by the {{senderName}} .{{/if}}  
{{#if !title}}- **Idea Title** â†’ A clear and concise title for the idea.{{/if}}  
{{#if !description}}- **Idea Description** â†’ An explanation of the idea.{{/if}}  

## **Next Steps**  
To proceed, please ask the missing details.
In order to guide the ideator, if necessary, give some insight about how the idea could better meet the values of Consensys Network State (CNS) 
If you feel that the idea needs to be refined, tell the {{senderName}} to feel free to come back later when the idea will be more refined and mature, taking the time to develop it further before submission.`;

const valueAlignmentScoring = `## **Idea Evaluation & Scoring**

Evaluate the idea proposed by **{{senderName}}** based on its alignment with the **core values and strategic priorities** of the Consensys Network State (CNS). Assign **individual ratings (1-100) per criterion**, and compute an **overall score**.

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Evaluation Criteria**
Assess the idea based on the following **key dimensions**:

1. **Value Alignment** â€“ How well does the idea align with CNS principles like decentralization, privacy, open-source ethos, and censorship resistance?
2. **Innovation** â€“ Does the idea introduce novel approaches, technologies, or perspectives?
3. **Need & Relevance** â€“ Does the idea address a real problem or opportunity within the CNS ecosystem?
4. **Feasibility** â€“ How realistic is the implementation in terms of resources, technology, and adoption?
5. **Sustainability & Long-Term Viability** â€“ Can the idea sustain itself economically and environmentally over time?
6. **Scalability** â€“ Is the idea designed to function effectively as adoption grows?
7. **Governance & Coordination** â€“ Does the idea enhance on-chain or off-chain governance, collaboration, or decision-making?

## **Response Format**
Return a **JSON markdown block** containing:
- The **title** of the idea.
- A **score (1-100) per criterion**.
- A **global rating** (average of all scores).
- A **concise rationale** explaining the evaluation.

}
\`\`\`

## **Instructions**
- **Provide a score (1-100) for each criterion** based on how well the idea meets it.
- **Calculate the global rating** as the average of all scores.
- **Justify** the evaluation with a brief rationale covering strong and weak points.
- **Do not** return a response if the idea lacks sufficient detail for evaluation.
- **If unclear**, infer a reasonable estimate but highlight any uncertainties. `;
