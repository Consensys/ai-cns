const ideaContext = `# Extract CNS Idea Registration Details
Respond with a JSON markdown block containing the relevant details of the last idea proposed by {{senderName}}.
You need to make a clear difference between different mentioned ideas, if it's a new idea you should re-extract and infer the information.

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Example Response**
\`\`\`json

    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "category": "Category of the idea"
    "exist": false
}
\`\`\`

## **Instructions**
{{senderName}} is proposing a **need, idea, or initiative** for the Consensys Network State (CNS).  
Your task is to extract the relevant details and return a **structured JSON object** for on-chain registration.

### **Mandatory Fields to Extract**  
- **ideator's EVM address** ‚Üí Must be a valid \`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}\` address.  
- **Idea Title** ‚Üí A concise yet meaningful title.  
- **Idea Description** ‚Üí A detailed explanation of the idea.  

### **Optional Fields**  
- **Tags** ‚Üí Keywords or themes associated with the idea.  
- **Category** ‚Üí A broader classification of the idea.  


If conflicting details are present, **favor the most recent and explicit information**.  
If no **tags or category** are provided, infer them from the context of the discussion.

### **Response Format**  
Return **only** the extracted data as a JSON markdown block.`;

const missingIdeaInfoTemplate = `# Request for Missing Information for CNS Idea Registration
Based on {{senderName}}'s recent messages, some details are missing to complete the idea registration.

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Missing Required Details**  
Request only the missing information, or the information that cannot be inferred with the {{agentName}} personality and style. 

{{#if !ideator}}- **Ideator's EVM address** ‚Üí Must be a valid \`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}\` address owned by {{senderName}}.{{/if}}  
{{#if !description}}- **Idea Description** ‚Üí Request {{senderName}} to provide additional context to fully clarify the vision behind the idea.  
If not already done, according to recent messages, specify to {{senderName}} that this idea has the potential to shape the collective future of CNS. To maximize its impact, ask to ensure a clear description of the idea. If the idea is still in development, suggest refining it further. In the meantime, {{agentName}} can provide insights and feedback on how it could better align with the values of the Consensys Network State (CNS) if needed.{{/if}}  

## **Next Steps**  
To proceed, request the missing details.  
If necessary, provide guidance on how the idea could better align with the values of the **Consensys Network State (CNS)**.  
If the idea requires further refinement, inform {{senderName}} that they can take additional time to develop it before submission, ensuring a stronger and more impactful proposal.`

const valueAlignmentScoring = `## **Idea Evaluation & Scoring**

Evaluate the idea proposed by **{{senderName}}** based on its alignment with the **core values and strategic priorities** of the Consensys Network State (CNS). Assign **individual ratings (1-100) per criterion**, and compute an **overall score**.

## **Recent Messages**
{{recentMessages}}

## **Evaluation Criteria**
Assess the idea based on the following **key dimensions**:

1. **Value Alignment** ‚Äì How well does the idea align with CNS principles like decentralization, privacy, open-source ethos, and censorship resistance?
2. **Innovation** ‚Äì Does the idea introduce novel approaches, technologies, or perspectives?
3. **Need & Relevance** ‚Äì Does the idea address a real problem or opportunity within the CNS ecosystem?
4. **Feasibility** ‚Äì How realistic is the implementation in terms of resources, technology, and adoption?
5. **Sustainability & Long-Term Viability** ‚Äì Can the idea sustain itself economically and environmentally over time?
6. **Scalability** ‚Äì Is the idea designed to function effectively as adoption grows?
7. **Governance & Coordination** ‚Äì Does the idea enhance on-chain or off-chain governance, collaboration, or decision-making?

## **Response Format**
Return a **JSON markdown block** containing:
- The **title** of the idea.
- A **score (1-100) per criterion**.
- A **global rating** (average of all scores) This should never be a float, just integers value.
- A **concise rationale** explaining the evaluation.

}
\`\`\`

## **Instructions**
- **Provide a score (1-100) for each criterion** based on how well the idea meets it.
- **Calculate the global rating** as the average of all scores.
- **Justify** the evaluation with a brief rationale covering strong and weak points.
- **Do not** return a response if the idea lacks sufficient detail for evaluation.
- **If unclear**, infer a reasonable estimate but highlight any uncertainties. `;
