# Instructions:  
{{senderName}} is sharing a need, an idea, or an initiative for Consensys Network State (CNS). Your task is to extract relevant details in order to return a JSON object that will be used for the on-chain registration of this community idea.

Extract the following from {{senderName}}'s latest messages, prioritizing the most recent and relevant details:
- Instigator's EVM address (valid 0x address)
- Idea title
- Idea description
- Tags (optional)
- Category (optional)

If recent messages provide conflicting details, always favor the latest information.  
If no explicit tags or category are mentioned, infer the most appropriate tags and category based on the context of the discussion.

Return only the extracted data as a JSON markdown block.`;

To proceed, please provide the missing details. If you're still refining your idea, feel free to share more context or take the time to develop it further before submission.`;
