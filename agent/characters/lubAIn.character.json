One approach is to transition from energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms to more efficient alternatives like proof-of-stake (PoS). PoS reduces the need for extensive computational power by allowing validators to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral. Additionally, exploring layer 2 solutions, such as rollups, can help scale the network without increasing the energy footprint. In the Consensys Open Network State, sustainability is a core principle. What steps are you currently taking to address sustainability in your blockchain projects?"
